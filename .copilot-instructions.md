# Copilot Instructions for Kiwi Ledger

## Project Overview

This is a React Router v7 application for tracking household expenses, built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. Data is stored in Google Sheets via the Google Sheets API.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React Router v7 with SSR
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui components
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Data**: Google Sheets API integration
- **Date handling**: date-fns library

## Comments

- Only add comments when code is unexpected or non-obvious
- Comments should explain **why** a choice was made, not **what** the code does
- Keep code self-documenting through clear naming and structure
- Example of good comment: `// Using custom calc() because Tailwind spacing doesn't work with viewport-relative positioning`
- Example of bad comment: `// Set the button size to 16`
